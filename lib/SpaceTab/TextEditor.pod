SpaceTab::TextEditor - Basic Lightweight User-friendly TextEditor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	require SpaceTab::TextEditor;
	SpaceTab::TextEditor::edit($filename);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BLUT is a built-in text editor based on Curses::UI.

It was made because vim is too hard for unprepared newbies, and nano too,
really: not everyone knows that C<^X> means Ctrl+X, making nano almost as hard
to exit as vim. And of course, none of the really user friendly editors out
there would work well on our old IBM 3151 terminal. (For instance, C<^S> and
C<^Q> are used for software flow control, or as the manual of said terminal
calls it, "pacing".)

And of course, all the editors out there will let you open other files, or even
run shells...
